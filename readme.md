### So what is this?
> This repository serves as a sort of folder or a collection of files and images for my proposed website for the [school I was interned in](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nXSSRhYwREe6CQks6). While I acknowledge that the code structure might not be perfect and could face challenges when deployed online, it represents a starting point for this project :)

### Why am I doing this?
This is my way of showing appreciation to the school where I interned for almost four months. The experience taught me new skills, not only in web development but also in handling and understanding kids. Although I’m aware that teaching isn’t my strong suit, the internship gave me invaluable life lessons, and I feel indebted to the school.

### Acknowledgments
* Overall, big shoutout to those who've been part of the four-month internship. I'm just so glad we made it to the end
