  A war criminal, by definition, is an individual responsible for violating
  international laws of war, committing atrocities such as genocide, torture, or
  other inhumane acts against civilians. Despite the existence of global
  institutions like the [International Criminal Court](https://www.icc-cpi.int/)
  (ICC), many war criminals evade justice due to political alliances, power
  dynamics, and strategic interests. This failure to hold perpetrators
  accountable undermines global justice, as evidenced by the case of Indonesian
  former general and now, the current President of Indonesia, Prabowo Subianto
  and his connection to both domestic atrocities and U.S. support during the
  Cold War.

### Allegations of Atrocities

<div className="text-justify">
  Prabowo Subianto, a former 5 star general and now serve as the President of
  Indonesia, has been repeatedly accused of war crimes and human rights
  violations. His military career was marred by allegations of involvement in
  abductions, torture, and killings, particularly during the late 1990s, when
  Indonesia was grappling with political instability. As commander of the
  Special Forces (*Kopassus*), Prabowo allegedly orchestrated the disappearance
  of pro-democracy activists and played a role in suppressing dissent in [East
  Timor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_invasion_of_East_Timor),
  [Aceh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Aceh_Movement), and
  [Papua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_Papua_Movement).
</div>

<div className="text-justify">
  These atrocities occurred during the final years of Indonesia’s authoritarian
  New Order regime, led by his then father in law, President Suharto. Despite
  being dismissed from the military in 1998 following an internal inquiry,
  Prabowo has __never faced prosecution__. Instead, he reinvented himself as a
  politician, running for Indonesia’s presidency multiple times, and remains a
  powerful figure in the country’s political landscape.
</div>

### The U.S. and Its Role in Indonesian Atrocities

<div className="text-justify">
  The impunity enjoyed by figures like Prabowo is not solely a domestic failure.
  It is deeply entwined with the geopolitical strategies of powerful nations
  like the United States. During the Cold War, the U.S. supported Suharto's New
  Order regime, which came to power following the [mass
  killings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indonesian_mass_killings_of_1965%E2%80%9366)
  of 1965-1966. An estimated 500,000 to 1 million people, many accused of being
  communists were murdered in a campaign of political purges.
</div>

<div className="text-justify">
  [Declassified
  documents](https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/indonesia/2017-10-17/indonesia-mass-murder-1965-us-embassy-files)
  reveal that U.S officials provided intelligence, lists of suspected
  communists, and even tacit approval of the massacres. Washington saw Suharto
  as a bulwark against the spread of communism in Southeast Asia, prioritizing
  strategic interests over human rights. The atrocities were brushed aside as
  collateral damage in the ideological battle against the Soviet Union.
</div>

<div className="text-justify">
  Prabowo’s rise within this framework highlights how U.S. foreign policy
  enabled and even legitimized war criminals. His education at American
  institutions such as [Fort Benning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Moore),
  known for training foreign military personnel, further underscores the
  complicity of the U.S in supporting individuals accused of severe human rights
  abuses.
</div>

### Why War Criminals Evade Accountability

<div className="text-justify">
There are several reasons why individuals like Prabowo Subianto avoid justice. __First__, powerful allies often shield them. In this case, U.S support for Indonesia’s military and political elite provided cover for decades of abuse. __Second__, domestic legal systems in countries like Indonesia may lack the political will or capacity to prosecute high-ranking officials. The intertwining of political and military power creates an environment where impunity thrives.

Finally, international mechanisms like the ICC face limitations. Indonesia, for example, is **NOT** a party to the [Rome Statute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/States_parties_to_the_Rome_Statute) that established the ICC, meaning __its citizens cannot be prosecuted unless referred by the UN Security Council__, a highly politicized body where powerful nations like the U.S hold veto power.
</div>

### A Call for Accountability

<div className="text-justify">
The continued prominence of figures like Prabowo Subianto and the legacy of U.S. complicity in mass killings serve as a stark reminder of how justice is often sacrificed for political convenience. To ensure accountability, global powers must prioritize human rights over strategic alliances.

Moreover, the international community must strengthen mechanisms for prosecuting war crimes and empower local activists and civil society to demand justice. Until then, the evasion of accountability by war criminals will remain an enduring stain on the promises of international law and human rights
