  [Tame Impala](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tame_Impala)’s 2015 masterpiece,
  [Currents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currents_(album)), transcends its
  status as a critically acclaimed album to become a cultural touchstone. [Kevin
  Parker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kevin_Parker_(musician))’s exploration
  of self-discovery, love, and change finds new life in the digital age,
  amplified by the rise of TikTok edits and internet memes. Songs like “*Let It
  Happen*,” “*The Less I Know the Better*,” “*New Person, Same Old Mistakes*,”
  and “*Eventually*” resonate not only with their initial audience but also with
  a younger generation drawn to their emotional depth and cinematic quality.
  This essay explores how these tracks shape Currents’ narrative and how they’ve
  been reinterpreted through the lens of modern pop culture phenomena.

### _Let It Happen_: The Anthem of Existential Cool

<div className="text-justify">
  “*Let It Happen*,” with its sprawling, psychedelic production, has emerged as
  a cultural anthem, particularly in TikTok edits and the “*__he’s so me__*”
  meme culture. This track’s themes of surrendering to life’s chaos resonate
  with characters known for their internal struggles, like Walter White
  ([Breaking
  Bad](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Breaking_Bad_(TV_series))), Saul
  Goodman ([Better Call
  Saul](https://breakingbad.fandom.com/wiki/Better_Call_Saul_(TV_series))), and
  K ([Blade Runner
  2049](https://bladerunner.fandom.com/wiki/Blade_Runner_2049)). Edits often
  pair the song’s hypnotic beats with slow-motion or montage clips, creating a
  sense of epic self-awareness. Ryan Gosling’s characters, from Drive to Blade
  Runner 2049, embody the song’s reflective yet detached energy, making “*Let It
  Happen*” the perfect backdrop for the meme that playfully declares, “*__He’s
  so me__*.”

<div className="text-justify">
  These reinterpretations highlight the song’s universality. Its repeated
  refrain: ♪*Just let it happen, let it happen*♪ becomes a mantra for characters
  grappling with their destinies, blending existential dread with a hint of
  acceptance. The track’s glitching breakdowns and soaring synths mirror the
  fractured, complex emotions that define these iconic figures.
</div>

### _The Less I Know the Better_: The Sting of Unrequited Love

<div className="text-justify">
  Arguably one of Tame Impala’s most iconic songs, “*The Less I Know the
  Better*” is a bittersweet anthem of rejection and longing. Its funky bassline
  and infectious groove belie the emotional vulnerability of the lyrics, which
  tell a story of heartbreak and self-inflicted denial. The song’s central
  theme, that ignorance might offer temporary solace in the face of romantic
  disappointment, is encapsulated in the refrain, “*The less I know, the
  better*.” Parker’s layered production amplifies the tension, blending retro
  and modern sounds to create a track that feels timeless. It’s a danceable
  heartbreak, a paradox that defines much of Currents’ charm.

### _New Person, Same Old Mistakes_: The Struggle of Reinvention

<div className="text-justify">
  Closing the album, “*New Person, Same Old Mistakes*” reflects the cyclical
  nature of self-improvement and the difficulty of breaking free from old
  habits. With its hazy synths and measured pace, the track feels like a
  contemplative conclusion to the album’s journey. Parker’s echoed vocals convey
  an inner dialogue, wrestling with the fear of being stuck despite efforts to
  grow: “*Feel like a brand-new person, but you’ll make the same old mistakes*.”
  It’s a brutally honest reflection of the human condition, acknowledging that
  while change is essential, it is often accompanied by recurring patterns and
  doubts. The track’s introspective nature leaves the listener both unsettled
  and inspired.

### _Eventually_: The Pain of Letting Go

<div className="text-justify">
  “*Eventually*” is a heart-wrenching meditation on the inevitability of
  endings, whether in relationships or phases of life. The song’s melancholic
  tone and soaring melodies make it a standout, offering a poignant exploration
  of love’s bittersweet nature. Lyrics like ♪*But I know that I’ll be happier,
  and I know you will too*♪ reflect a painful but necessary acceptance that
  moving on is sometimes the kindest choice for all involved. Parker’s
  production perfectly complements the emotional weight of the lyrics, with
  swirling synths and a cathartic crescendo that evoke the simultaneous feelings
  of loss and liberation.
</div>

### Conclusion: _Currents_ in the Flow of Culture

<div className="text-justify">
  Currents is more than an album; it’s a timeless exploration of transformation
  and resilience. The rise of TikTok edits and internet memes has given songs
  like “*Let It Happen*,” “*The Less I Know the Better*,” “*New Person, Same Old
  Mistakes*,” and “*Eventually*” a second life, connecting them to new audiences
  and contexts. By pairing these tracks with characters and stories from shows
  like Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul, and films like Blade Runner 2049, the
  internet has reimagined Parker’s work as a soundtrack to existential
  reflection and meme-fueled catharsis. In doing so, Currents continues to
  evolve, much like the themes of change and acceptance it so beautifully
  captures.
