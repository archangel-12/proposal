- if there is a hydration, consider to change the ``<div>`` or ``<p>``, 

- ```html
    <div className="text-center">
      ## hi smantass...
    </div>
  ```

- ````html
    <div className="text-justify">
      ### when we win, do not forget that these people want you broke, dead, your kids r***d and brainwashed, and they think it's funny
    </div>

- ```html
    <img
     src="..."
     alt="..."
    />
  ```
