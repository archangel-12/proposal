- if there is a hydration, consider to change the ``<div>`` or ``<p>``, 

- ```html
    <div className="text-center">
      ## hi smantass...
    </div>
  ```

- ````html
    <div className="text-justify">
      ### I don't think in 'win-lose.' I think in domination
    </div>

- ```html
    <img
     src="..."
     alt="..."
    />
  ```
