### So what is this?
This repository serves as a sort of folder or a collection of files and images for my proposed website for Senior High School 17 of Surabaya. While I acknowledge that the code structure might not be perfect and could face challenges when deployed online, it represents a starting point for this project.

### Why am I doing this?
This is my way of showing appreciation to the school where I interned for almost four months. The experience taught me new skills, not only in web development but also in handling and understanding kids. Although I’m aware that teaching isn’t my strong suit, the internship gave me invaluable life lessons, and I feel indebted to the school.

### What tools and plugins did you use while creating this website proposal?

1. [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

    - Imagine Next.js as a __recipe book__ for creating websites. Instead of starting from scratch and guessing how to make a dish, you follow the recipe to get consistent results. Next.js helps organize all the parts of a website like text, images, and feature so they work together seamlessly.

2. [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

    - Tailwind CSS is like a box of pre-cut, colorful building blocks for website design. Normally, building a website’s design (like colors, fonts, and spacing) feels like cutting wood and measuring every single piece yourself, it’s slow and exhausting. Tailwind gives you ready-made blocks, so you just snap them together to create beautiful designs quickly.

3. [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)

    - Think of shadcn/ui as furniture that comes pre-assembled. Need a button? A menu? A table? Instead of crafting these things yourself, shadcn/ui gives you stylish, pre-built versions that you can use immediately. It saves a ton of time and ensures your “*house*” (website) looks neat and consistent.

4. [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/)

    - Framer Motion is like adding moving decorations to a shop window. Instead of everything being static, you can add gentle movements, like a picture sliding in, or a button bouncing when clicked. It makes the website feel alive and engaging, drawing people in.

5. [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)

    - MDX is like a notebook where you can mix illustrations and text on the same page. Usually, writing website content and programming it are done separately, which can get confusing. MDX lets you combine them, so everything stays in one place, making it easier to manage and edit later.
